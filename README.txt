ABOUT:

GETTING STARTED:
This project has both a client and a server. In order for the game to properly run both need to be running...

Inside the root directory run:
npm install

Inside the client directory run:
npm install
npm run build

To launch the project start both the server and the client simultaneously:
npm run start

Open two tabs, http://localhost:8080, to start the game.
