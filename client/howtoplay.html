      <h2>How To Play</h2>
      <p>
        This game plays very similarly to Uno, except it is themed around OSU’s
        College of Engineering. In this version, colors are now majors and the
        numbers are different classes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Major card:</strong> Replaces the wild card in Uno. Whoever
          plays this card gets to change the major, meaning only cards of the
          same major can be played right after.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Class card:</strong> Replaces the traditional numbered cards
          in Uno. Each card will have a class number along with its associated
          major. When this kind of card is played, only cards of the same
          major(s) can be played.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Additional Card Types:</strong> To be included later in
          development.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you don’t have a playable card in your hand, you must draw until you
        get one. The win condition in this game is akin to Uno, where you must
        play every card in your hand until you have none left.
