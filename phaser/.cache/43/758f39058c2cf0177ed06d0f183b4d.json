In this version, colors are now majors and the\n        numbers are different classes.\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Major card:</strong> Replaces the wild card in Uno. Whoever\n          plays this card gets to change the major, meaning only cards of the\n          same major can be played right after.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Class card:</strong> Replaces the traditional numbered cards\n          in Uno. Each card will have a class number along with its associated\n          major. When this kind of card is played, only cards of the same\n          major(s) can be played.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Additional Card Types:</strong> To be included later in\n          development.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        If you don’t have a playable card in your hand, you must draw until you\n        get one. The win condition in this game is akin to Uno, where you must\n        play every card in your hand until you have none left.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <!-- </section> -->\n  </body>\n</html>\n"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"efc3d6c036d9709e50bede7ec9f4489e","cacheData":{}}
