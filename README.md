# CS 46X Template Repository

Demonstration repository for CS 46X

## Project Structure

Inside of your repository, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
.
├── docs/
├── src/
├── wip/
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

The `docs/` directory hold a standalone Starlight + Astro website. Check below for more.

The `src/` directory will contain your codebase.

The `wip/` directory is your Work in Progress directory. It contains assignment templates that you will modify/update during the year. You can add more files there that support your project (e.g., diagrams, design files, documents, reviews, progress reports, etc.)

The `LICENSE` is currently CC0 and will need to be changed by the end of the year.

## Grading

Throughout the year, everyone on the team will be evaluated on their writing (individually). Instructors will review writing assignments mostly in GitHub Pull Requests (PRs).

Writing assignments will include:

- documentation (through PRs)
- product requirements (through PRs)
- user stories (using GitHub Issues)
- software development process (through PRs)
- progress reports

Whenever an assignment can be reviwed in a GitHub PR, please assign your instructors for review.

## A Few Things to Address

Once you've cloned, forked, or simply copied the content of this repository to your own:

- Invite your co-contributors/co-developers to make changes to the repository
- Change the license (currently CC0), discuss that with your project partner or sponsor
- Initialize the repository for your programming language (your code should probably end up in `src/`), including updating the `.gitignore`
- Learn to build the `docs/` (see below) or opt for another documentation solution
- Check out the course templates in `wip/`
- Create your first issues and organise them in a project/kanban board

## Building the Docs

Your docs template is Starlight. It's a template for [Astro](https://astro.build/).

Astro is a very fast and efficient framework, in particular for static content (like docs or a product page).

This repository `docs/` directory was already initialized with Starlight. Check the `docs/README.md` file to get started.
